This repo provides a simulation to test the approach from An N-of-1 Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem for Individual-Centered Care paper.

Moving away from traditional monolithic models, we focus on creating a system that accounts for patient variability, rare conditions, and underrepresented demographics, addressing the average patient fallacy that can erode equity and trust in healthcare AI.

The ecosystem clusters agents by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities, with each agent drawing from a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. A coordination layer integrates these results, evaluating reliability, uncertainty, and data density to provide clinicians with comprehensive decision-support packetsâ€”risk estimates, confidence intervals, outlier flags, and linked evidence. This model shifts validation from population averages to individual reliability, focusing on error in low-density regions, small sample calibration, and risk-coverage trade-offs.

The system tackles key challenges such as computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit through caching, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks, aligning with the core principle of medicine: transparent, equitable, and patient-centered care.
